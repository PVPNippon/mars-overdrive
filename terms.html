  </p>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    PVP and its directors, officers and employees do not accept or consider unsolicited idea or product submissions of any
    kind (e.g. game or other product ideas, stories, screenplays, artwork, musical or audiovisual works, concepts or any
    other creative materials) in any format, by means of any transmission (“Unsolicited Content”). Please do not submit any
    Unsolicited Content to PVP or its directors, officers, or employees. However, if you submit Unsolicited Content to us,
    you agree that such Unsolicited Content will not be treated as confidential, regardless of any statement to the contrary
    in the Unsolicited Content, any accompanying message, or elsewhere.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="my-8">
  <h2 class="mb-4 font-semibold">5. User Interactions</h2>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    PVP assumes no responsibility for the conduct of other users of the Services or for monitoring the Services for
    inappropriate content or conduct. PVP does not, and cannot, pre-screen or monitor all content or conduct of users. Your
    use of the Services is at your own risk.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    You acknowledge that PVP is not a party to any dispute you may have with any other user(s) of the Services. PVP has no
    obligation to become involved in any such dispute. You release PVP and its subsidiaries (and PVP’s and its subsidiaries’
    officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, shareholders and employees) from all claims, demands, and damages related
    to any such dispute.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="my-8">
  <h2 class="mb-4 font-semibold">6. Suspension and Termination for your Breach</h2>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    We reserve the right to take the following actions (i) limit, suspend, and/or terminate your access to the Services with

  </p>
</section>
<section class="my-8">
  <h2 class="mb-4 font-semibold">7. Availability, Compatibility, and Changes to the Services</h2>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    PVP does not guarantee that the Services are available at all times or will continue to be available in the future. The
    Services may be temporarily unavailable due to technical issues or maintenance related reasons, which may occur on a
    scheduled or unscheduled basis. Furthermore, the Services or parts thereof may be designed to be available only for a
    limited time (e.g. when content is seasonal or early access is provided to a development version of a game), or their
    life cycle may be affected by technological developments or changes in consumer behavior. Accordingly, PVP reserves the
    right to stop offering and/or supporting the Services or parts thereof (e.g. a game or a feature of a game) at any time,
    at which point your license to use the Services or such parts thereof will be terminated automatically. Where
    appropriate, PVP will take reasonable measures to provide advance notice when any Services or parts thereof are
    discontinued. However, PVP may limit, suspend or terminate the Services or parts thereof without notice, and take
    technical and legal steps to prevent you from accessing the Services, if PVP believes you or any other user(s) are
    causing a risk of legal liability or infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or are not acting in
    accordance with the letter or spirit of these TOS.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    The Services may have limited compatibility across different devices and operating systems. You are responsible for
    verifying that the Services are compatible with your device and its operating system. Generally, more information
    regarding compatibility requirements is available at the point of first use or download (e.g. in the relevant app
    store).
  </p>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    The Services are intended to evolve over time. Accordingly, PVP may change, manage, modify, or update the Services or
    parts thereof (including, but not limited to, Virtual Items) from time to time. This may result in content or features
    being added, removed, or modified (e.g. gameplay modes or areas being added or removed or Virtual Items having their
    appearance or power altered). PVP may, at its sole discretion, make any such changes as it believes to be necessary to
    maintain and improve the Services, including, but not limited to, introducing, modifying, or removing game content and
    features according to PVP’s development roadmap, adapting to new technologies, reflecting changes to PVP’s agreements
    with third parties, preventing abuse or technical issues, and addressing any legal, safety, or regulatory requirements.
    When changes are made to the Services, you may be required to download and install an update to continue using them. If
    you do not, you may be unable to access or use the Services or parts thereof (e.g. online play and features may only be
    available to those who are using the latest version of a game).
  </p>
</section>
<section class="my-8">
  <h2 class="mb-4 font-semibold">8. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, the Services are provided to you “AS IS,” without warranty,
    assurances, or guarantees of any kind. The Services may have defects, and your use is solely at your risk. PVP does not
    make, and hereby disclaims any and all express, implied or statutory warranties, including implied warranties of
    condition, uninterrupted use, accuracy of data (including, but not limited to, location data), merchantability,
    satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights, and warranties (if any)
    arising in the course of dealing, usage, or trade practices. PVP does not warrant against interference with your
    enjoyment of the Services; that the Services will meet your requirements; that operation of the Services will be
    uninterrupted or error-free; that the Services will interoperate or be compatible with any other services; or, that any
    errors in the Services will be corrected. No oral or written advice provided by PVP, its employees or other
    representatives constitute a warranty.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    Some jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers such as those set forth above; thus, the above terms may not apply to you.
    Instead, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing disclaimers shall only apply to the extent permitted by the laws of such
    jurisdictions. Moreover, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in these TOS shall
    infringe upon the statutory rights that you may have as a consumer of the Services. Specifically, if you are a consumer
    based in the EEA, you are provided with a legal guarantee of conformity under which PVP may be liable for a lack of
    conformity that you discover: (i) within two years from any one-time supply of the Services (such as the supply of a
    Virtual Item); or (ii) at any time during any continuous supply of the Services.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="my-8">
  <h2 class="mb-4 font-semibold">9. Limitations of Liability</h2>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    In no event will PVP be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from access, use or
    malfunction of the Services, including, but not limited to, damages to property, loss of goodwill, device failure or
    malfunction and, to the extent permitted by law, damages for personal injuries, property damage, lost profits or
    punitive damages from any causes of action arising out of or related to these TOS or the Services, whether arising in
    tort (including negligence), contract, strict liability or otherwise and whether or not PVP has been advised of the
    possibility of such damages.For purposes of this Section “Limitations of Liability,” PVP’s licensors and other partners
    are third-party beneficiaries to the limitations of liability specified herein and may enforce these TOS against you.

  </p>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability such as those stated in this Section; thus, the above
    terms may not apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the limitations of liability in this Section shall apply
    only to the extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Moreover, you may have additional legal rights in your
    jurisdiction, and nothing in these TOS will infringe upon any statutory rights you may have as a consumer of the
    Services.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base mb-4">
    You agree to indemnify, defend and hold PVP and its subsidiaries (and PVP’s and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors,
    agents, joint ventures, shareholders and employees) harmless from any claim, demand, damages, or other losses, including
    reasonable attorneys’ fees, asserted by any third party resulting from or arising out of your use of the Services or any
    breach by you of these TOS; however, the foregoing does not apply if the third-party claim is not attributable to your
    intentional or negligent behavior.

    makes any promises regarding the content, goods or services provided by such third parties. PVP is not liable to you for
    any losses or harm caused by such third parties or any charges you incur in relation to such third parties. You
